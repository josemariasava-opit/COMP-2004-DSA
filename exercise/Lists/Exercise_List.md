### Exercise 1: Basic Linked List Creation
**Goal:** Create a simple linked list with a single node.

1. Define a structure for a node that contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
2. Write a function to create a new node with a given integer value.
3. Write a main function to create a linked list with one node and print the value stored in that node.

### Exercise 2: Traverse the Linked List
**Goal:** Traverse the linked list to print all its values.

1. Modify your linked list structure to hold multiple nodes (i.e., create at least 3 nodes).
2. Write a function that loops through the list and prints each value.
3. Print the linked list values in the main function.

### Exercise 3: Inserting a New Node at the Beginning
**Goal:** Add a new node at the beginning of the linked list.

1. Write a function to insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
2. Modify the main function to insert a few nodes at the beginning and print the linked list.

### Exercise 4: Deleting a Node
**Goal:** Delete a specific node from the linked list.

1. Write a function to delete a node by its value.
2. Modify the main function to delete a node and print the resulting list.
3. Handle edge cases such as deleting the first node or a node that doesn't exist.

### Exercise 5: Inserting a Node at the End
**Goal:** Insert a new node at the end of the linked list.

1. Write a function to add a node to the end of the list.
2. Modify the main function to insert a few nodes at the end and print the linked list.

### Exercise 6: Reversing the Linked List
**Goal:** Reverse the linked list.

1. Write a function that reverses the linked list.
2. Modify the main function to reverse the list and print the result.

### Exercise 7: Finding the Length of the List
**Goal:** Count the number of nodes in the linked list.

1. Write a function that calculates and returns the length of the list.
2. Call this function in the main function to display the length of the linked list.

### Exercise 8: Detecting a Loop
**Goal:** Detect if there is a loop in the linked list (optional but challenging).

1. Write a function to detect if there is a loop in the linked list. You can implement the "tortoise and hare" algorithm to solve this.
2. Test your function with a list that has a loop and one that doesn't.
